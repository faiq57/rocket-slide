<h1>&ltFaiq's siblings&gt</h1>

<hr>

<h3>Quick Preface</h3>

<p>Substracting me from the amount of children my parents had, there's 6 of them. I'm the eldest at 19. The disclaimer that I would like to put here is that in no way does the order or the pictures I picked represent any sort of favoritism toward any one of my siblings. It's mainly due to time constraints (and me being lazy) that there exists some photos of poor quality whether that be in terms of the resolution or the framing.</p>

<h2>Izz Farish</h2>

<p>This is the sibling that is two years younger than me. He's the closest to me in terms of age. What he likes to do nowawadays are playing volleyball. We used to fight a lot back in the day (before secondary school) but we're good now. We're more mature now. It's fun to talk about mechancical things like bicycles and earphones with this boy. Plus, he'll always lend a ear if I want to vent or make stupid jokes.</p>

<h2>Emir</h2>

<p>Emir is a strange boy with a fixation into whatever he's fixated on. As he's four years young than me, I find it incredible how he had beaten me in most of things that he puts his time in, even things that I myself had put quite the hour in. In typing for example, this boy regularly hits speed above 100 WPM. I guess young people nowadays are just that good.</p>

<h2>Ilm</h2>

<p>I think he's a good person. But this boy who's 6 years my young does make it a habit to retort everything his smaller siblings say or does at him. When interacting with younger people, there are times when it is best we give in. If a scolding is really needed, it's okay to just put on a stern voice and look angry. Other than that, Ilm is a survivor of Bone Tuberculosis, a very rare form of Tuberculosis. I usually talk with him about shows that he's watching.</p>

<h2>Read</h2>

<img src="photo/Read.jpg" alt="Photo including Read">

<p>Read is he boy with the red shirt. The reason that he's the only one in a group photo is because I can't seem to find a photo of him within the media that I have access to. But that aside, he's 8 years younger than me and he likes to play mobile games. I think as a boy almost reaching 11 years of age, he should mature up and act less than some whiny boy off the side of the road. Other than that, he's very energetic and I think that's a good thing.</p>

<h2>Rumi</h2>

<p>She's the only daughter in the family. At 11 years my junior, Rumi is very mature for her age. It's fun to play with her. I like to throw her up and catch her back on the way down. It's my way of multitasking, exercising while entertaining kids. She likes candy a lot and she gives in a lot if her younger brother (yet to be elaborated about) disturb her. Though if she's infuriated enough, she does fight back her little brother.</p>

<h2>Liam</h2>

<p>Liam is the youngest boy in the house. He's 12 years younger than me and he have curly hair. The interesting thing about him is that he always have great retorts to people inquiries. Even if they're not correct sometimes, it's always funny to ask a question to this young fellow and listen to his response. Though as he's young, he does have his own antics that sometimes drive her big sister (Rumi) mad. As for me, I can just lift him and put him someplace else if irritate me too much (which seldom happens).</p>
