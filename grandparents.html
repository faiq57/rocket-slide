<h2>My Father's Parents</h2>

<p>My father's father is a man named Abdul Halin bin Hamid. He used to be a lecturer at UPM before he retired. My grandmother, Sharifah Zaleha binti Syed Hassan is a year older than her husband. Before she retired, she used to also work as a lecturer but at UKM instead. Now, they stay at a small but cozy terrace at Bandar Baru Bangi. My grandfather is fine for the most part but my grandmother seems to be experiencing some health issues due to her age. Please pray for their health and happiness.</p>

<h2>My Mother's Parents</h2>

<p>These are my mother's parents. My grandmother is Siti Zainab binti Nong Ahmad. She used to be chocolatier before she retired. At heart, she's still a young and lively lady. A good contrast to her relaxed husband, Abdul Aziz bin Alias who used to be a technician (IIRC) before retiring.</p>
