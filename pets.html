<h2>Manja</h2>

<img src="photo/Manja.jpg" alt="Manja the cat">

<p>A female cat that we took in as a kitten a few years back. I think it is deaf because no matter what happens around it, be it loud vacuum cleaners, children screaming or a power supply exploding, it won't care! But if anybody is eating, you can be sure this cat will be there.</p>

<h2>Raggy</h2>

<img src="photo/Raggy.jpg" alt="Raggy the cat">

<p>The bossiest cat in the house! Raggy will come ask to be pet, and once it had enough, Raggy will just scratch yo' face! Claws out and all! </p>

<h2>Kuna</h2>

<img src="photo/Kuna.jpg" alt="Kuna the cat">

<p>Contrary to what one might believe when hearing about its' name, Kuna is actually a male. Very good cat but Kuna sometimes randomly pee around the house. Although it has been months since he last did that.</p>
