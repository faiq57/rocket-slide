  <p>My name is Faiq and I have a family. It's great to have a family. You can talk to them and they'll help you when it gets tough. In return though, you should also help them out when they're in a pinch. Family is a very important part of our identity as they're usually the people we're first introduced to in our life. I enjoy living with my family, so I made this site to showcase them and highlight their qualities (and maybe some flaws) for others to see.</p>
